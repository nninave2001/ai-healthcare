# 🏥 AI in Healthcare: Hospital Readmission Prediction

This project uses real-world EHR data to predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days. It demonstrates a full machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and interpretation.

## 📌 Features
- Preprocessing of clinical and demographic variables
- Training a Random Forest classifier
- Evaluation using classification report and confusion matrix
- Visualization of top predictive features

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter.
2. Replace the sample dataset with a larger dataset from sources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set).
3. Run each cell in order.

## 📈 Sample Output
- Confusion Matrix and F1-Score
- Feature Importance Plot

## 🧠 Next Steps
- Add SHAP/LIME for interpretability
- Try logistic regression or XGBoost
- Deploy as a web app using Flask
